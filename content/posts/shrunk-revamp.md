## Modernizing

At Rutgers University, I was tasked with maintaining the URL Shortener used by faculty and professors.

Previously, to run the developer version of the full-stack project on your machine, you had to have two terminal tabs open while following a long set of build instructions. I stepped in and introduced Docker into the project so the only command you have to remember one command to build the project.
